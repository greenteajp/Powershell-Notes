ACTIVITY 1: Find Cmdlets



Ensure that you have the latest copy of help by updating your help system.
#update-help


Which cmdlets deal with the viewing/manipulating of processes?
#get-process; start-process; stop-process; wait-process; debug-process


Display a list of services installed on your local computer.
#get-service


What cmdlets are used to write or output objects or text to the screen?
#write-host


What cmdlets can be used to create, modify, list, and delete variables?
# clear-variable; get-variable; new-variable; remove-variable; set-variable



What cmdlet can be used, other than Get-Help, to find and list other cmdlets?
#get-command


Find the cmdlet that is used to prompt the user for input.
#read-host





ACTIVITY2: Running Cmdlets


Display a list of running processes.
#get-process

Display a list of all running processes that start with the letter "s".
#get-process 'S*'

Find the cmdlet and its purpose for the following aliases:
#


gal
#gal -> Get-Alias

dir
#dir -> Get-Childitem

echo
#echo -> Write-Output

?
#? -> Where-Object

%
#% -> ForEach-Object

ft
#ft - > Format-Table




Display a list of Windows Firewall Rules.
#Get-NetFirewallRule

Create a new alias called "gh" for the cmdlet "Get-Help"
#Set-Alias -Name gh -Value Get-Help
##-name and -value are optional



ACTIVITY 3: Variables

Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.
set-varaible var1 (Get-Random -min 25 -max 50)

Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.
set-varaible var2 (Get-Random -min 1 -max 10)

Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.
$sum=$var1+$var2

Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.
$sub=$var1-$var2

Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.
$prod=$var1*$var2

Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.
$quo=$var1/$var2

Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
Write-Host "$var1" + "$var2" = "$sum"


"var1" + "var2" = "sum"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
Write-Host "$var1" - "$var2" = "$sub"


"var1" - "var2" = "sub"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
Write-Host "$var1" * "$var2" = "$prod"


"var1" * "var2" = "prod"





Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:
Write-Host "$var1" / "$var2" = "$quo"


"var1" / "var2" = "quo"



ACTIVITY4: Reverse Arrays



Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point.  The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0.
The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.

$arr=@(-9..12)

For example, if the first random number is -3, and the second random number is 2, your array will be -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2







Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
$newarr=$arr[-2..-22]

Using the above example, your reversed array will be 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3
